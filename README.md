# Simple Text Editor Website

this is a repository of website [texteditor.maxistar.me](https://texteditor.maxistar.me) website. If you are looking for code of android application Simple Text Editor, you probably need link to [this repository](https://github.com/maxistar/TextPad).

The project is created with Static Site Generator Metal Smith. It is not guaranteed that this generator will be used in the future so I tried to make this technology agnostic as much as I can.
