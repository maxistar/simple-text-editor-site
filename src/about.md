# About

This is simple text editor that can help you with editing text files.

This editor mostly used by me for small text notes, write down ideas while I have a break.

Supports only plain text files at the moment.

The code is open so can review code, send pull requests, new features, translations and so on. https://github.com/maxistar/TextPad.

Any suggestions for this project are welcomed. Thank you!
