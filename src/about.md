# About

This is a minimalist text editor designed to assist with editing text files.

I primarily use this editor for jotting down brief notes or capturing ideas during breaks.

At present, it supports only plain text files.

The code is open source, allowing you to review it, contribute pull requests, suggest new features, provide translations, and more. https://github.com/maxistar/TextPad.

Suggestions for enhancing this project are greatly appreciated. Thank you!
