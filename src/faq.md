# Frequently Asked Questions

> I cannot save a file opened through the Android file picker.

Regrettably, the Android file picker does not permit files to be opened with write permissions. To make a file editable, please use the "open" command from the Simple Text Editor menu. I am currently exploring better solutions to address this limitation, but at present, no alternative is available. If you are aware of any applications capable of editing such files, please do not hesitate to inform me.

If you are enthusiastic about a particular feature being implemented, kindly submit a feature request [here](https://github.com/maxistar/TextPad/issues). Please be patient, as new features may not be added immediately. This application is free, and my time to dedicate to its development is limited.

If you encounter a bug or an issue, please report it [here](https://github.com/maxistar/TextPad/issues). I kindly ask for your understanding if the resolution takes time, as this application is free, and my resources to address issues promptly are limited.
